# Indirect-Dark-Matter-Detection

The purpose of this repository is to make avaliable the code used to fit curves of mass distribution and rotation curves on models of dark matter presence in galaxies and nebulae. The code is written in python. This is part of a FAPESP scholarship: https://bv.fapesp.br/en/bolsas/192826/study-on-indirect-dark-matter-seach/.

Here the notebooks rotation_curves.ipynb and capstone.ipynb are used to display fits of three models of dark matter distribution in data from galaxies taken from articles relevant in the area. The fits were done using python libraries like matplotlib, scipy was used for nonlinear regression, numpy was used for linear algebra and more known libraries. I created a big class (the class isn't that beautiful but does a god job) that does all the calculations and data preprocessing necessary. Also, statistical tests to check the goodness-to-fit and where the fit does better were done.
