# Indirect-Dark-Matter-Detection

The purpose of this repository is to make avaliable the code used to fit curves of mass distribution and rotation curves on models of dark matter presence in galaxies and nebulae. The code is written in python. This is part of the project funded by FAPESP: https://bv.fapesp.br/en/bolsas/192826/study-on-indirect-dark-matter-seach/.
